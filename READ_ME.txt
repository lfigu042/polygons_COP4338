Programming assignment 4


Program stores and manipulates a list of >1000 polygons.


Program accepts five commands:
        1- ‘quit’ ends the program
        2- ‘add’ will add the specified number of vertices to the list of polygons.
The ‘add_n_gon()’ method is called and adds as many vertices as are passed.  
        3-’summary’ will calculate the total number of polygons, vertices, and the centroid. 
        4- ’turn’ updates the shiftDirection based on the value of the strings “left”, “right” etc.
        5- ‘shift’ updates the coordinates of the polygon’s vertices that are stored on the specified index from the polygon list. Depending on the direction specified, the coordinates will be increased or decreased.
